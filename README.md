# vectors
School project on analytic geometry and ray tracing in C.

Project outline:
1. Implement standard operations on 3D real vectors (vector.h and vector.c).
2. Represent geometrical objects (lines, planes, spheres) and calculate intersections (objects.h and objects.c).
3. Implement laws of geometrical optics (optics.h and optics.c).
4. Combine everything into a ray tracing graphics engine.

Realization of each step:
A. Teacher provides header file(s) with function declarations and intent.
B. Studends work out the function definitions (corresponding C file) and perform some testing.
C. Teacher verifies functionality.
